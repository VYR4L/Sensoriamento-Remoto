# Welcome to the spacial fusion app tutorial!

First of all, check my GitHub repository for more info and/or sugestions: **https://github.com/VYR4L/Sensoriamento-Remoto**

## Now, to the tutorial:

1. Choose the fusion method.

2. If you don't have the .tif files downloaded yet, click the API button, if you already did it, skip to the 4 step.

3. In the API screen, you'll need to:
    * Enable your Google Earth Engine API;
    * Import your API file;
    * Inform your api email account;
    * Insert the ID from the image;
    * Choose the satellite (for now we just have CBERS and Landsat), then you'll insert the data and the size of the imagem that you want. You can resize and get a better slice of the terrain in **https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/**
    

4. You will need to import 2 images for both method: one for the multispectral image (bands 2 to 5 on Landsat and B1 to B4 on CBERS-4A) and one for the panchromatic band (band 8 on Landsat and P on CBERS-4A).

5. After that, you'll click in "Fuse images", a file will be generated and you'll choose where to save the file.
That's it, you're ready to use the app!
